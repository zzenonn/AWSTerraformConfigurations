# Sample EKS Auto Mode Cluster

This Terraform template creates an EKS cluster using EKS Auto Mode. The ALB controller, CSI Addon, and Karpenter Installation no need to be installed manually and are all managed by EKS Auto Mode. Just apply the configuration and that's it! You're ready to deploy manifests.
